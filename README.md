# Learn Go with Tests Exercises

![Repository Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-green.svg)

This repository contains my personal exercises and implementations based on the book **[Learn Go with Tests](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests)** by [quii](https://github.com/quii). The book is an excellent resource for learning Go by following a test-driven development (TDD) approach. You can also explore the book's content online at **[Learn Go with Tests GitBook](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/)**.
